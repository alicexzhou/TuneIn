{"name":"Tune In!","tagline":"","body":"### Description\r\nThe game consists of a virtual keyboard, each key having a different color and pitch. At each level, a short sample of a tune will be given to the player, along with a visual representation of the tune using the corresponding keyboard keysâ€”that is, after the tune is being played, the keys used in the melody will appear in color. The user's goal is to replicate the pattern of the sounds created by clicking on each key in the correct order. Each level intensifies in length to increase the difficulty.\r\n\r\n### Uses\r\nThe game could potentially be used for ear training, a common component within music theory. The user must consider which direction the pitches are being inflected in order to recognize which notes are being played.\r\n\r\n### Screencast\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
